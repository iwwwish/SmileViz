SMILES Visualizer
========

SMILES Visualizer is a simple, on-the-top desktop application that visualizes the SMILES provided. It is especially useful in interpreting SMILES step by step (atom-by-atom). It differs from the commercially available structure visualizers in the following ways:

1. you need not hit enter each time you update the smile or enter a new atom (visualization is dynamically updated)
2. any error in the smile will be displayed (dynamic)
3. you can instantly save the molecule as PNG, SDF or MOL by a simple right-click
4. you will not need internet

A demonstration of SMILES Visualizer can be found in my blogpost.
