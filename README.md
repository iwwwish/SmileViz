SMILES Visualizer
========

SMILES Visualizer (SmileViz) is a simple, always-on-top, java-based desktop application that visualizes the SMILES input provided. It is very useful in interpreting SMILES step by step (atom-by-atom) and checking how the connectivity proceeds. The light-weight visualizer differs from the commercially available structure visualizers in the following ways:

1. You need not hit enter each time you update the smile or enter a new atom (visualization is dynamically updated),
2. Any error in the smile will be displayed (dynamically),
3. You can instantly save the molecule as PNG, SDF or MOL by a simple right-click,
4. Lastly, you will not need Internet.


A demo for SMILES Visualizer can be found in my [blogpost](http://vishalkpp.blogspot.de/2014/02/simple-smiles-visualizer.html).
