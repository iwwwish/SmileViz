SMILES Visualizer
========

SMILES Visualizer is a simple, on-the-top desktop application that visualizes the SMILES provided. It is especially useful in interpreting SMILES step by step (atom-by-atom). It differs from the commercially available structure visualizers in the following ways:

1. you need not hit enter each time you update the smile or enter a new atom (visualization is dynamically updated)
2. error in the smile will be displayed (dynamic)
3. you will not need internet

More about the application can be found in my blogpost.
